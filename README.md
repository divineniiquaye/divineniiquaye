I'm a Software Engineer with over 3 years experience in programming web based, software and other technologies. Since early of 2017 I started to code, it has become a passion of mine. I love to explore new technologies, constantly learn and help contribute on open-source projects. Also like to share my knowledge, passionate, and somewhat meticulous about programming and tech in general. Having a strong foundation in building web apps especially using [PHP](https://php.net) and [Java](https://java.com).

ðŸ”­ Currently working at [Biurad Lap](https://biurad.com/), Anyway I'm always active at GitHub.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm working on amazing projects for the opensource community. Funding my works will be appreciated.

âš¡ Motivation: It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop...

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to programming by creating a new issue at this repo.

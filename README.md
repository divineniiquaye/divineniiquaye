I'm a motivated, team-oriented, and passionate software engineer who enjoys creating and engaging with projects that enhance business productivity, education, developers’ insight, and brings about innovation. Since early **2017** I started to code, it has become a **TRUE** passion of mine. I truly believe in continued education and research, which I constantly do and help contribute to open-source projects when I can.
